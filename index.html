                    <p>
                        Scott Rinaberger is a versatile individual who challenges himself every day to be a wiser, more-knowledgeable, more-aware, and more-giving contributor to all of his communities he participates. <br>
                        <br>
                        Teammates in his professional community will find Scott to be thought-provoking as he seeks to find the best practices or new, innovative ways to achieve the desired customer result. He puts in the time, research, and experimentation to model the possible ways to a correct result. As there are many “right” ways to a correct result, Scott works collaboratively with stakeholders who may be impacted by the various ways to achieve a result to assure the final solution is the best for as many stakeholders as possible. <br>
                        <br>
                        Scott developed his leadership philosophy, relying on more than 30 years of senior management experience. He learned there are core leadership traits that are key to successful management through his management of teams over 100 and teams as small as 5. <br>
                        <br>
                        A great leader is one who leads by example, being integrated into a team and not above the team. A great leader can quickly assess the situation, seek out points-of-failure and identify solutions, in a respectful and constructive process to assure his team feels valued and allowed to take risks without repercussions. A great leader is always seeking to provide the right tools to his team instead of trying to fix it for them. A great leader promotes development and pushes all teammates to grow, even if it as the risk someday of the leader being pushed aside. <br>
                        <br>
                         The most important aspect of Scott in his communities, is his sense, a need, of giving. Scott’s opportunities and successes over the years were due in a large part of being surrounded by many “givers.” From family who provided financial support, to teachers and educators who pushed him to seek more, and to incredible bosses and employers who nudged him up the ladder, he holds a responsibility to pay the same forward in all aspects of his life.

                        Scott began his corporate career as a temporary doing 10 key punch. He quickly became a reconciliation guru and finding missing funds. After a few months, he was hired on full time and began serving in various management roles in the Operational Accounting Department at the St. Louis Service Center. <br>
                        <br>
                        While serving in these roles, Scott got his first glimpse into project management on technical aspects of operations. He was inspired by how much easier and better processes could be and was motivated to seek out the best solutions. He would end up serving on many project teams spending several months at a time in other service centers such as New York City, Chicago, Miami, Sioux Falls, and San Antonio.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="jobduties">
                        After three years at Citi, Scott was recruited by Boatmen’s Bank to assist them in identifying large losses in the rollout of the ground-breaking debit card. Scott leveraged his experience at Citi and quickly developed logic testing and report criteria that was missing in the daily batch processing of transactions. This project succeeding with the posting of missing debits to customers’ accounts and the bank recouping the missing funds. <br>
                        <br>
                        This project caught the eyes of a few senior leaders at Boatmen’s. Scott was reassigned to the Operational Transition Team where he worked with the technology department to map out best practices between Boatmen’s Bank and their acquired banks. This required significant travel and utilizing skilled interactions as the acquired personnel where less than cooperative much of the time. <br>
                        <br>                    
                        Scott’s career in operational banking progressed quickly when NationsBank acquired Boatmen’s. His deep knowledge of technical and procedural mapping, complimented by his political savviness of the new culture, led to several promotions and ultimately the senior leader for Card Services on the NationsBank National Transition Team when NationsBank acquired Bank of America. He would spend each week being on-site at either Charlotte, Pheonix, San Francisco, or Seattle.<br>
                        <br>
                        Post-acquisition, Scott was promoted to Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning & Payment Strategies within Card Services. He worked closely with all payment channels within Bank of America to assure the proper investments were being made into the most profitable payment channels. Scott also worked heavily with VISA on VISA’s new third-party payment process, VISA DPS. During this time, Scott become known as one of the knowledge-base leaders in future payments types such as chip-based cards, check truncation and electronification, and alternative electronic funds. He did extensive travel to Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas in support of the efforts. <br>

                        Scott joined MasterCard after an aggressive recruiting effort to lure him away from Bank of America and his association with VISA. Scott’s role as Vice President of Global Transaction Processing was to work with the new GTP team to identify new opportunities throughout the world to leverage MasterCard’s transaction processing platform. <br>
                        <br>
                        While MasterCard was, and is a global, brand, their transaction processing platform was only seeing half of the credit and debit card transactions occurring globally. This was due to political barriers, technological limitations, or other third-party processing arrangements which by-passed the global platform. <br>
                        <br>
                        Also, there was an emergence of new processing technologies occurring at or new the point-of-sale, such as phone and gift card activation, and medical information sharing, which MasterCard had presence but not the developed technology platforms to be a player in these segments. <br>
                        <br>
                        Scott, along with his peers, developed and implemented a global strategy through either new partnerships (i.e. Malaysian Electronic Payments System) or existing partnerships to grow their core transactional processing while also seeking acquisition targets for quick entry into the developing alternative POS transaction processing segments. Scott traveled extensively to Asia, Australia, and the Americas in support of the execution of the strategy. <br>

                        After several years in corporate life, Scott found the amount of time traveling was impacting himself and his family. Scott and his wife Sheila embarked on careers of entrepreneurs, taking on the risk for great rewards, and applying all the skills and knowledge they both developed in years of business and education. <br>
                        <br>
                        Over the past 14 years, their entrepreneurial spirit have led them to open two award-winning The Goddard School franchises, brought the School of Rock franchises to St. Louis, and take McArthur’s Bakery into a new phase of bakeries. <br>
                        <br>
                        But, the most rewarding business opportunities for Scott is the opening of The Pioneer Bakery Café and the start-up of The Smiley Face Cookie Company. Both new ventures are focused on the mission to develop and train adults with intellectual disabilities for a competitive workforce. These programs are empowering the most under-employed U.S. population segment for a life of meaning. <a href="https://fb.watch/ew7UqZHuEH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about The Pioneer Bakery Cafe.</a>
