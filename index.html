                        Scott Rinaberger is a versatile individual who challenges himself every day to be a wiser, more-knowledgeable, more-aware, and more-giving contributor to all of his communities he participates. <br>
                        <br>
                        Teammates in his professional community will find Scott to be thought-provoking as he seeks to find the best practices or new, innovative ways to achieve the desired customer result. He puts in the time, research, and experimentation to model the possible ways to a correct result. As there are many “right” ways to a correct result, Scott works collaboratively with stakeholders who may be impacted by the various ways to achieve a result to assure the final solution is the best for as many stakeholders as possible. <br>
                        <br>
                        Scott developed his leadership philosophy, relying on more than 30 years of senior management experience. He learned there are core leadership traits that are key to successful management through his management of teams over 100 and teams as small as 5. <br>
                        <br>
                        A great leader is one who leads by example, being integrated into a team and not above the team. A great leader can quickly assess the situation, seek out points-of-failure and identify solutions, in a respectful and constructive process to assure his team feels valued and allowed to take risks without repercussions. A great leader is always seeking to provide the right tools to his team instead of trying to fix it for them. A great leader promotes development and pushes all teammates to grow, even if it as the risk someday of the leader being pushed aside. <br>
                        <br>
                         The most important aspect of Scott in his communities, is his sense, a need, of giving. Scott’s opportunities and successes over the years were due in a large part of being surrounded by many “givers.” From family who provided financial support, to teachers and educators who pushed him to seek more, and to incredible bosses and employers who nudged him up the ladder, he holds a responsibility to pay the same forward in all aspects of his life.
